# Pi integration

ContextCrawler ships a Pi (https://pi.dev) extension that rewrites bash
commands to use `contextcrawler` for token savings, plus a guidance
block upserted into the user's `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`.

## Files

- `rtk-extension.ts` — the Pi extension. Embedded into the binary via
  `include_str!` from `src/hooks/init.rs` and written verbatim to
  `~/.pi/agent/extensions/contextcrawler.ts` on `contextcrawler init
  --agent pidev`.
- Guidance content lives in `hooks/shared/guidance.md` (the canonical
  source) and is composed per-harness by `agent_guidance(AGENT_PIDEV)`
  in `src/hooks/init.rs`.

## How the extension works

Pi's [`createBashTool`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/bash-spawn-hook.ts)
helper exposes a `spawnHook({command, cwd, env}) -> {command, cwd, env}`
callback that fires before each bash invocation. The extension shells
out to `contextcrawler rewrite <command>` (the single source of truth
for rewrite rules — `src/discover/registry.rs`) and returns the
rewritten command. On any error the original command passes through
unchanged.

This mirrors the OpenCode plugin (`hooks/opencode/rtk.ts`): thin
delegate, no JS-side rewrite logic to drift.

## Editing rewrite rules

Edit `src/discover/registry.rs` in the ContextCrawler repo. The Pi
extension picks up changes immediately on the next Pi session because
it re-shells `contextcrawler rewrite` per command.
